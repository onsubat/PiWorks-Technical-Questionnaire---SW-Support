// QUESTION - 4

SELECT SUM(x) FROM (SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT userId) AS x
FROM i_user_login_logs
GROUP BY userId
HAVING COUNT (*) > 3
ORDER BY userId ASC);

// It counts number of each different users and shows total result in a single row.



//QUESTION - 5

SELECT i_users.userId, username, email,COUNT(i_user_login_logs.userId) AS [RepUserId] FROM i_user_login_logs 
INNER JOIN i_users ON i_user_login_logs.userId = i_users.userId 
GROUP BY i_user_login_logs.userId
HAVING username != "administrator"
ORDER BY RepUserId DESC LIMIT 1;

/* This query shows the user which logs in the most except "administrator". 
It shows result as; userId | username | email | number of logins*/
